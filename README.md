- 👋 Hi, I’m @aurilongui
- 👀 I have 2 years of experience in web development, with a particular interest in backend development. I have mainly worked with Java and Spring Boot, but I also have experience in frontend technologies like React and Vue. I have experience working with RESTful APIs (including standards like OpenAPI) and, to a lesser extent, with SOAP. I have managed relational databases such as PostgreSQL and non-relational ones like MongoDB. 
- 🌱 Recently, I have explored PHP in projects using Laravel, Vue, and Inertia, which has allowed me to deepen my understanding of backend/frontend integration and uncover its potential.
- 💞️ While my experience with unit testing, microservices, and Docker is more limited, I am eager to continue developing my skills in these areas.
